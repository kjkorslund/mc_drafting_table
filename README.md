Drafting Table - A design tool and schematic editor for Minecraft

Drafting Table is a project I undertook back in 2014 to create a web application that could assist with planning builds in the Minecraft video game.  I had originally hoped to commercialize it somehow, but didn't generate much interest in the community, and I eventually abandoned the project.  I've decided now to make the source code for the project publicly available, for others to study.  I am not able to actively develop it myself, but if anyone likes the tool and wants to develop it further, feel free to fork the project.

A link to a working prototype of the web app can be found at the project blog:  https://mcdraftingtable.blogspot.com/
